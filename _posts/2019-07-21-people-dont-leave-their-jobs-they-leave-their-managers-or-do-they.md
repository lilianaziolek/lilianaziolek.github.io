Every now and again I come across this "pearl of wisdom" (in slightly different variations):

> People don't leave bad jobs / companies, they leave because of bad bosses / managers

Whilst I'm sure this is true in some/many cases, I always hear an internal voice of protest.

I've been in the industry for close to 15 years. I went through a number of different bosses/projects (a lot of them contracts). In all of my career, I left due to my management exactly once.

All the other times?
* it was always supposed to be a short-term engagement (early in career - internships etc.)
* a (small) company lost a client I was at, so was forced to change my role and I prefered to stay a developer
* I wanted to travel more and my job-at-the-time couldn't offer enough flexibility (switched from perm to contracts)
* the project has reached a maintenance phase, a big part of the team was leaving, plus I wanted to go onto a long holiday
* a different offer, "too good to pass", came my way - I wasn't looking at the time, but I decided I had to take it
* the project was coming to a slow, uncertain phase (lack of funding), my contract was up for renewal and I decided not to
* I decided to work on my own startup (plus, funding for project running out)

Vast majority of cases where I stopped working for my managers, it was one of two reasons (sometimes both at the same time):
* the project was winding down anyway and it was time to move on (as a contractor you always take into account that after the active phase, the contract might not be renewed)
* other circumstances completely outside of control of my manager (my travel-bug, or another amazing offer)

In all these cases I always made an effort to explain my reasons to my boss. In all cases I found understanding, we split our ways with no hard feelings, and in fact some of my ex-bosses became my again-bosses later on.

I really wish this quote stopped doing rounds, because I feel it might be putting unnecessary feeling of *"what did I do wrong / what could I have done better"* on many perfectly good managers out there.

So to all of them, take my word: **Sometimes a person handing in your notice is really not your fault, and there is absolutely nothing you could have done to prevent this.**

What were your reasons for leaving your role? What's your ratio of bad-boss-vs-other-reasons? Was I very lucky - or are "bad bosses" not that common after all?
